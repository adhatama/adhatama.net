My name is A.M. Adhatama, from Yogyakarta, Indonesia.

I currently focus on Web Programming using Go and Vue. Previously, I mostly did programming in PHP Laravel or Groovy Grails for my last company's clients.  
I think I can understand programming better and can do more things if I learn Go, so I decided to stick with it.  
I am working on my ability to test my code too, because I believe that every serious project had better have automated test.  

I can do some play with piano. When I want to sing, I use my guitar.  
Here's my current piano songlist: (Recorded soon)

- Yiruma - River Flows in You
- Yiruma - Love Me
- Final Fantasy 8 - Breezy
- Beethoven - Moonlight Sonata
- Chopin - Prelude in E-Minor (op.28 no. 4)

My ultimate goal is to master Debussy - Clair de lune
