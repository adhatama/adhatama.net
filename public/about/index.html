<p>My name is A.M. Adhatama, from Yogyakarta, Indonesia.</p>

<p>I currently focus on Web Programming using Go and Vue. Previously, I mostly did programming in PHP Laravel or Groovy Grails for my last company&rsquo;s clients.<br />
I think I can understand programming better and can do more things if I learn Go, so I decided to stick with it.<br />
I am working on my ability to test my code too, because I believe that every serious project had better have automated test.</p>

<p>I can do some play with piano. When I want to sing, I use my guitar.<br />
Here&rsquo;s my current piano songlist: (Recorded soon)</p>

<ul>
<li>Yiruma - River Flows in You</li>
<li>Yiruma - Love Me</li>
<li>Final Fantasy 8 - Breezy</li>
<li>Beethoven - Moonlight Sonata</li>
<li>Chopin - Prelude in E-Minor (op.28 no. 4)</li>
</ul>

<p>My ultimate goal is to master Debussy - Clair de lune</p>
