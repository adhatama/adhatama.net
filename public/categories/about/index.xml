      <description>My name is A.M. Adhatama, from Yogyakarta, Indonesia.
I currently focus on Web Programming using Go and Vue. Previously, I mostly did programming in PHP Laravel or Groovy Grails for my last company&amp;rsquo;s clients.
I think I can understand programming better and can do more things if I learn Go, so I decided to stick with it.
I am working on my ability to test my code too, because I believe that every serious project had better have automated test.</description>
